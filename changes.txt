Change made:  Changed variable memberNumber to idNumber in various places including in method names.
Reason:       Better name.

Change made:  Renamed class model.Model to model.Coordinator.
Reason:       From a review advise and it also describes better what the class does.

Change made:  In classes model.Member and model.Boat removed toString methods .
Reason:       Those where incorrectly used to pass formatted strings to the view when a member was viewed.

Change made:  In class view.MemberLookAtView rewrote most of the code.
              In class presenter.Presenter rewrote the functionality regarding how information was collected
              from the model and provided to class view.MemberLookAtView.
Reason:       It was necessary since the toString methods were removed from the classes model.Member 
              and model.Boat.

              Removed method setMemberNumber.
              Added method getAllBoatsData. 
              Added method getBoatType.
              Added method getBoatLength.
Reason        The removed method was not used. The added methods were necessary since the responsibility to 
              collect boat data was moved to the presenter.

              Removed method memberToString.

              Added method getMemberAllBoatsData.
              Added method getAllMembers.
Reason        The removed methods were not used anymore. The new methods were needed because various 
              responsibilities were moved to the presenter.

Change made:  In class model.Member removed methods getCompactData and getVerboseData.
              Added class presenter.ListHelper and added the functionality from the removed methods
              getCompactData and getVerboseData to that class.
Reason:       Those methods where specialized to match two methods in the view.

Change made:  In class model.Member added methods getBoatType and getBoatLength and removed method getBoat.
              In class presenter.ListVerboseHelper replaced any references to the class model.Boat with calls 
              to those two new methods.
Reason:       Thereby the dependency from presenter.ListVerboseHelper to model.Boat could be removed.

Change made:  Merged classes view.BoatRegisterView, view.BoatChangeView and view.BoatDeleteView into one new
              class named view.BoatHandlerView.
