Change made:  Changed variable memberNumber to idNumber in various places.
Reason:       Better name.

Change made:  Renamed class model.Model to model.Coordinator.
Reason:       From a review advise and it also describes better what the class does.

Change made:  In classes model.Member and model.Boat removed toString methods .
Reason:       Those where incorrectly used to pass formatted strings to the view when a member was viewed.

Change made:  In class view.MemberLookAtView rewrote most of the code.
              In class presenter.Presenter rewrote the functionality regarding how information was collected
              from the model and provided to class view.MemberLookAtView.
Reason:       It was necessary since the toString methods were removed from the classes model.Member 
              and model.Boat.

Change made:  In class model.Member removed methods getCompactData and getVerboseData.
              Added class presenter.ListHelper and added the functionality from the removed methods
              getCompactData and getVerboseData to that class.
Reason:       Those methods where specialized to match two methods in the view.

Change made:  In class model.Member added methods getBoatType and getBoatLength and removed method getBoat.
              In class presenter.ListVerboseHelper replaced any references to the class model.Boat with calls 
              to those two new methods.
Reason:       Thereby the dependency from presenter.ListVerboseHelper to model.Boat could be removed.

Change made:  Merged classes view.BoatRegisterView, view.BoatChangeView and view.BoatDeleteView into one new
              class named view.BoatHandlerView.
Reason:       From a review advise (almost) also it makes sense.
