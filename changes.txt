Change made:	In class model.Member:
                	Removed method "public String[][] getAllBoatsData()".
              	In class model.MemberArchive:
                	Removed method "public String[][] getMemberAllBoatsData(int idNumber)", 
			(that used method "public String[][] getAllBoatsData()" from Model.Member).
              	In class model.Coordinator:
                	Removed method "public String[][] getMemberAllBoatsData(int idNumber)", 
			(that used method "public String[][] getMemberAllBoatsData(int idNumber)" 
			from Model.MemberArchive).
              	Changed name on class presenter.ListHelper to presenter.DataGatherer.
              	In class presenter.DataGatherer:
                	Added methods:
                  		public String getName(int idNumber).
                  		public String getPersonalNumber(int idNumber).
                  		public String[][] getBoatData(int idNumber).
              	In class presenter.Presenter:
                	In method "private void memberLookAt()":
                  		Removed call to model.Coordinator.getMemberAllBoatsData(idNumber).
                  		Added call to presenter.DataGatherer.getBoatData(int idNumber).
              	In class view.MemberLookAtView:
                	Removed methods:
                  		public void setIdNumber(int idNumber).
                 		public void setMemberName(String name).
                  		public void setMemberPersonalNumber(String personalNumber).
                  		public void setMemberAllBoatsData(String[][] allBoatsData).
                	Changed the method signature in method public void displayMemberInfo:
                  		from public void displayMemberInfo()
                  		to public void displayMemberInfo( 	int idNumber, 
                                                    			String name, 
                                                    			String personalNumber, 
                                                    			String[][] allBoatsData).
                  		Also changed the methods body accordingly.
              	All in all, class presenter.DataGatherer is now responsible for from class model.Member and
              	class model.Boat gather all data needed as parameters for method 
              	view.MemberLookAtView.displayMemberInfo used in presenter.Presenter.memberLookAt().           
Reason:       	One of the issues that should be fixed.
              	Better design. The presenter gathers the data and formats it in a suitable way for the view 
		instead	of the model doing the formatting.

Change made:  	In class model.Member:
                	Removed methods:
                  		public String getBoatType(int index).
                  		public double getBoatLength(int index).
                  		public void changeBoatType(int boatListNumber, String boatType).
                  	public void changeBoatLength(int boatListNumber, double boatLength).
                	Added method:
                  		public Boat getBoat(int index).                  
Reason:       	One of the issues that should be fixed.
              	Better design. All classes that needs some boat information now has to work with a Boat object
              	directly.
              
Change made:  	In class model.MemberArchive:
                	Removed methods:
                  		public void changeMemberName(int idNumber, String name).
                  		public void changeMemberPersonalNumber(int idNumber, String personalNumber).
                  		public String getMemberName(int idNumber).
                  		public String getMemberPersonalNumber(int idNumber).
                  		public String[][] getMemberAllBoatsData(int idNumber), (as mentioned before).
                  		public void addBoat(int idNumber, String boatType, double length).
                  		public void deleteBoat(int idNumber, int boatListNumber).
                  		public void changeBoatType(int idNumber, int boatListNumber, String boatType).
                  		public void changeBoatLength(int idNumber, int boatListNumber, double boatLength).
                  		public boolean existsBoat(int idNumber, int boatListNumber).
Reason:       	One of the issues that should be fixed.
              	Better design. One of the original design ideas was that all access to the classes model.Member 
		and model.Boat should go through model.Coordinator and model.MemberArchive. Once this was dropped 
              	these methods was no longer needed.

Change made:  	In class view.OptionsView:
                	Changed the method signature in method public void displayMenu:
                  		from public void displayMenu()
                  		to public void displayMenu(	String createMember, 
								String deleteMember, 
								String changeMember,
								String lookAtMember,
								String compactList,
								String verboseList,
								String registerBoat,
								String deleteBoat,
								String changeBoat,
								String saveMember,
								String quit).
		  		Also changed the methods body accordingly.
Reason:       	One of the issues that should be fixed.
              	The class presenter.Presenter now has to include the characters representing various menu 
              	options as parameters when calling method view.OptionsView.displayMenu. This removes a 
              	hidden depedency between the classes view.OptionsView and presenter.Presenter.

Change made:	Changed the class diagram accordingly to the changes made in the classes, e.g. added a few
		dependencies, removed and added some methods.
Reason:		To update the class diagram.

Change made:	Changed the association names to role names in the class diagram.
Reason:		One of the issues that should be fixed. 

Change made:	Added enum MenuOptions to package view. 
Reason:		In the feedback from the fix 3 suggestion was made that I should use an enum instead of passing
		Strings between the classes. Also, when looking for enum examples I found that Oracle wants you
		to use them, “You should use enum types any time you need to represent a fixed set of constants.
		That includes natural enum types such as the planets in our solar system and data sets where you
		know all possible values at compile time—for example, the choices on a menu, command line flags, 
		and so on.” (1).
