Change made:  In class model.Member removed methods getCompactData and getVerboseData.
              Added class presenter.ListHelper and added the functionality from the removed methods
              getCompactData and getVerboseData to that class.
Reason:       Those methods where specialized to match two methods in the view.

Change made:  In class model.Member added methods getBoatType and getBoatLength and removed method getBoat.
              In class presenter.ListVerboseHelper replaced any references to the class model.Boat with calls 
              to those two new methods.
Reason:       Thereby the dependency from presenter.ListVerboseHelper to model.Boat could be removed.
