Change made:  In class model.Member:
                Removed method "public String[][] getAllBoatsData()".
              In class model.MemberArchive:
                Removed method "public String[][] getMemberAllBoatsData(int idNumber)", (that used method 
                "public String[][] getAllBoatsData()" from Model.Member).
              In class model.Coordinator:
                Removed method "public String[][] getMemberAllBoatsData(int idNumber)", (that used method 
                "public String[][] getMemberAllBoatsData(int idNumber)" from Model.MemberArchive).
              Changed name on class presenter.ListHelper to presenter.DataGatherer.
              In class presenter.DataGatherer:
                Added methods:
                  public String getName(int idNumber).
                  public String getPersonalNumber(int idNumber).
                  public String[][] getBoatData(int idNumber).
              In class presenter.Presenter:
                In method "private void memberLookAt()":
                  Removed call to model.Coordinator.getMemberAllBoatsData(idNumber).
                  Added call to presenter.DataGatherer.getBoatData(int idNumber).
              In class view.MemberLookAtView:
                Removed methods:
                  public void setIdNumber(int idNumber).
                  public void setMemberName(String name).
                  public void setMemberPersonalNumber(String personalNumber).
                  public void setMemberAllBoatsData(String[][] allBoatsData).
                Changed the method signature in method public void displayMemberInfo:
                  from public void displayMemberInfo()
                  to public void displayMemberInfo( int idNumber, 
                                                    String name, 
                                                    String personalNumber, 
                                                    String[][] allBoatsData).
                  (Also changed the body accordingly.)
              All in all, class presenter.DataGatherer is now responsible for from class model.Member and
              class model.Boat gather all data needed as parameters for method 
              view.MemberLookAtView.displayMemberInfo used in presenter.Presenter.memberLookAt().           
Reason:       One of the issues that should be fixed.
              Better design. The presenter gathers the data and formats it in a suitable way for the view instead
              off the model doing the formatting.

Change made:  In class model.Member:
                Removed methods:
                  public String getBoatType(int index).
                  public double getBoatLength(int index).
                  public void changeBoatType(int boatListNumber, String boatType).
                  public void changeBoatLength(int boatListNumber, double boatLength).
                Added method:
                  public Boat getBoat(int index).                  
Reason:       One of the issues that should be fixed.
              Better design. All classes that needs some boat information now has to work with a Boat object
              directly.
              
Change made:  In class model.MemberArchive:
                Removed methods:
                  public void changeMemberName(int idNumber, String name).
                  public void changeMemberPersonalNumber(int idNumber, String personalNumber).
                  public String getMemberName(int idNumber).
                  public String getMemberPersonalNumber(int idNumber).
                  public String[][] getMemberAllBoatsData(int idNumber), (as mentioned before).
                  public void addBoat(int idNumber, String boatType, double length).
                  public void deleteBoat(int idNumber, int boatListNumber).
                  public void changeBoatType(int idNumber, int boatListNumber, String boatType).
                  public void changeBoatLength(int idNumber, int boatListNumber, double boatLength).
                  public boolean existsBoat(int idNumber, int boatListNumber).
Reason:       One of the issues that should be fixed.
              Better design. One of the original design ideas was that all access to the classes model.Member and
              model.Boat should go through model.Coordinator and model.MemberArchive. Once this was dropped 
              these methods was no longer needed.

Change made:  In class view.OptionsView:
                Changed the method signature in method public void displayMenu:
                  from public void displayMenu()
                  to 	public void displayMenu(String createMember, 
							                                String deleteMember, 
							                                String changeMember,
							                                String lookAtMember,
							                                String compactList,
							                                String verboseList,
							                                String registerBoat,
							                                String deleteBoat,
							                                String changeBoat,
							                                String saveMember,
							                                String quit). 
Reason:       One of the issues that should be fixed.
              The class presenter.Presenter now has to include the characters representing various meny 
              options as parameters when calling method view.OptionsView.displayMenu. This removes a 
              hidden depedency between the classes view.OptionsView and presenter.Presenter.
