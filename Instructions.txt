1. Runnable version of the application.

The compiled program is stored as a jar file named MemberRegistry.jar. To run the program in a console, at the prompt, in the same directory as MemberRegistry.jar is stored, type "java -jar MemberRegistry.jar".

If option "save" is chosen from the menu in the program or the program is ended normally, i.e. by choosing option quit, then a file named "memberdata.data" will be created  in the same folder as "MemberRegistry.jar" is located. 
 
The program has been successfully tested in Linux Mint (similar to Ubuntu) and Windows 10.



2. The source code of the application.

The source code is located in the folder src.

To compile the program (one way of doing it) in a console.

Linux, (and probably Apple):  
1:  Copy all files including structure to a directory somewhere.
2:  In the directory where MemberRegistry.java is located, at the prompt, type "javac MemberRegistry.java". There should now be a *.class file to every *.java file in respective directory.
3:  Run the program by, at the prompt, type "java MemberRegistry".

Windows:
1:  Copy all files including structure to a directory somewhere.
2:  Set the CLASSPATH to include the directory where MemberRegistry.java is located. E.g. if MemberRegistry.java is located in c:\Users\Public\test\src then at the prompt, type "set CLASSPATH=%CLASSPATH%;c:\Users\Public\test\src.
3:  In the directory where MemberRegistry.java is located, at the prompt, type "javac MemberRegistry.java". There should now be a *.class file to every *.java file in respective directory.
4: Run the program by, at the prompt, type "java MemberRegistry".
